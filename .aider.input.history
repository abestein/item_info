+I need to create a user permissions management interface in my React/Antd application. My backend already supports user-specific page permissions with these API capabilities: Backend Context: Users can have either role-based permissions (fallback) or specific page permissions, Available pages: /dashboard, /users, /items, /reports, /settings, /upload, Current roles: admin, manager, user, readonly. What I need you to create: 1) User Permissions Management Page - A new page component that allows admins to: View a list of all users, Select a user to manage their permissions, See all available pages with checkboxes, Check/uncheck which pages that user can access, Save the user's specific page permissions, Option to "Use Role Permissions" (clears specific permissions, falls back to role-based). 2) API Integration - Create service functions for: GET /api/users/:id/permissions - Get user's current permissions, PUT /api/users/:id/permissions - Update user's permissions, GET /api/permissions/pages - Get all available pages. 3) UI Requirements: Use Antd components (Table, Checkbox, Button, Modal, etc.), Show user info (username, email, current role), Group permissions by category if possible, Show permission descriptions, Confirmation before saving changes, Success/error notifications. 4) Integration - Add a "Manage Permissions" button to the existing user management interface that opens this new permissions management view. Please create the components, services, and integrate them into the existing user management system. The design should be consistent with the current Antd theme and layout patterns used in the app.
